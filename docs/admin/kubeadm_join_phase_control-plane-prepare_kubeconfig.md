Generate the kubeconfig for the new control plane components

```
kubeadm join phase control-plane-prepare kubeconfig [api-server-endpoint] [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --certificate-key string                        Use this key to decrypt the certificate secrets uploaded by init. The certificate key is a hex encoded string that is an AES key of size 32 bytes.
      --config string                                 Path to a kubeadm configuration file.
      --control-plane                                 Create a new control plane instance on this node
      --discovery-file string                         For file-based discovery, a file or URL from which to load cluster information.
      --discovery-token string                        For token-based discovery, the token used to validate cluster information fetched from the API server.
      --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash strings          For token-based discovery, validate that the root CA public key matches this hash (format: "<type>:<value>").
      --discovery-token-unsafe-skip-ca-verification   For token-based discovery, allow joining without --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash pinning.
      --dry-run                                       Don't apply any changes; just output what would be done.
  -h, --help                                          help for kubeconfig
      --tls-bootstrap-token string                    Specify the token used to temporarily authenticate with the Kubernetes Control Plane while joining the node.
      --token string                                  Use this token for both discovery-token and tls-bootstrap-token when those values are not provided.
