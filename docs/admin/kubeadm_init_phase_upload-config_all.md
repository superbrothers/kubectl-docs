```

### Options

```
      --config string       Path to a kubeadm configuration file.
      --cri-socket string   Path to the CRI socket to connect. If empty kubeadm will try to auto-detect this value; use this option only if you have more than one CRI installed or if you have non-standard CRI socket.
      --dry-run             Don't apply any changes; just output what would be done.
  -h, --help                help for all
      --kubeconfig string   The kubeconfig file to use when talking to the cluster. If the flag is not set, a set of standard locations can be searched for an existing kubeconfig file. (default "/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf")
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --rootfs string   [EXPERIMENTAL] The path to the 'real' host root filesystem.
