Generates bootstrap tokens used to join a node to a cluster

### Synopsis

Bootstrap tokens are used for establishing bidirectional trust between a node joining the cluster and a control-plane node.

This command makes all the configurations required to make bootstrap tokens works and then creates an initial token.

```
kubeadm init phase bootstrap-token [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  # Make all the bootstrap token configurations and create an initial token, functionally
  # equivalent to what generated by kubeadm init.
  kubeadm init phase bootstrap-token
```

### Options

```
      --config string       Path to a kubeadm configuration file.
      --dry-run             Don't apply any changes; just output what would be done.
  -h, --help                help for bootstrap-token
      --kubeconfig string   The kubeconfig file to use when talking to the cluster. If the flag is not set, a set of standard locations can be searched for an existing kubeconfig file. (default "/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf")
      --skip-token-print    Skip printing of the default bootstrap token generated by 'kubeadm init'.
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --rootfs string   The path to the 'real' host root filesystem. This will cause kubeadm to chroot into the provided path.
```
